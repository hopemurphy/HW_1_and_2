#Homework Assignments

Problem 1: Special Relativity
  Ask for the value of x which is the distance between the spaceship and the planet in light years. 
  The time in years that it takes for the spaceship to reach its destination is printed as percieved by:
    the observer in the rest frame
      and
    the person in the spaceship

Problem 2: The semi-emperical mass formula
  Calculate the approximate nuclear binding energy B in MeV.
  a_1, a_2, a_3, and a_4 are given.
  Imput A and Z, then the value for B and B/A is printed.
